# ATM Fraud Detection System with Facial Recognition

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) Fraud Detection System using Facial Recognition. The system is designed to enhance the security of ATM transactions by incorporating facial recognition technology into the authentication process.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition:** Utilizes advanced facial recognition algorithms for user authentication.
- **Biometric Database:** Stores facial templates in a secure biometric database for comparison during transactions.
- **PIN Integration:** Combines facial recognition with traditional PIN-based authentication for enhanced security.
- **Liveness Detection:** Includes measures to detect and prevent spoofing attempts using liveness detection techniques.
- **Alerts and Monitoring:** Triggers alerts for suspicious activities and maintains logs for auditing purposes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that the required dependencies, including facial recognition libraries and machine learning frameworks, are installed. Refer to the documentation for specific details.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Configure the system by setting up parameters such as camera calibration, biometric database access, and security thresholds.

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Follow the provided instructions to build and run the application on your ATM system.

4. **Testing:**
   - Perform thorough testing to ensure the proper functioning of the facial recognition system in various scenarios.

## Usage

1. **Card Insertion:**
   - Users start by inserting their ATM card and entering their PIN as usual.

2. **Facial Recognition Scan:**
   - Simultaneously, the facial recognition system captures images of the user's face.

3. **Authentication:**
   - If the facial recognition system successfully matches the user's face with the stored template, and the entered PIN is correct, the transaction is authenticated.

4. **Alerts and Monitoring:**
   - Any suspicious activity triggers alerts for further investigation, with detailed logs available for auditing.
